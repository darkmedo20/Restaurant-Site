Welcome to the Restaurant website project, I lot of people seem overwhelmed by Django apps, this is a simple site done using Django Python Frameworks.

- I built the restaurant system with:
    - meals
    - ordered a meal
    - reserver a table
    - blog


I just had python basics to build this project.
    - simple python basics!  Django is built for Python. It's a web framework for Python. So it's a good idea to learn Python if you want to use Django. But you don't have to know advanced Python to take this course. 
      Building the site with django was very easy and i really had fun!.

clone the repository to run the app.
